    <h1>Airplanes Departing From New York Airports in 2021 and 2022 Report Having Wildlife Collision, on Ground And In Air

    <p class="subheadings">The </strong><a href="https://www.faa.gov"> Federal Aviation Administration</a> has open records revealing wildlife strike reports of all U.S States, but New York reports reveal more about its airports and departing airlines than just its wildlife strikes. </p>

      <p>Occurring anytime from December of 2021 to October of 2022, The Federal Aviation Administration has revealed that different types of wildlife are being stuck by aircrafts either on ground or in air that have departed from New York airports. Airports in a variety of sizes and locations in New York have reported hitting animals with passengers aboard. Animals ranging from coyotes to bats to all different sizes of birds.</p>
      <p>However, the FAA reveals that John F Kennedy International airport has had the most collision with wildlife. (interview form JFK about why). Even though spotting wildlife on the runway or in the air is envitable, it can still be scary for both private and commercial flyers. Furthermore, collisions happen at various times of day and year, but most frequently in late september.
 <a href="https://www.jfkairport.com/"> John F Kennedy International Airport.</a></p> 



      <p>The FAA reveals that small birds like an American Kestrel, the Barn Swallow and the European Starling are most likely to be hit.   </p>
      <p> However, collisions are more lucky to result in the bird being unknown due to the inability to recognize species, whether the animal was stuck in the plane or not or if it had died and dropped out of the sky or just flew away. </p>
      <p>Airlines keep reports on notes taken during occurrences by pilot or after occurrence by maintenance. This reveals what took place during the strike and what if any damage happened  to the aircraft. </p>
